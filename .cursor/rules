# Cursor Rules for QA Admin Dashboard

## Project Context
This is an administration dashboard for quality assurance (QA) test management built with React, TypeScript, Firebase, and Material-UI. The project uses React Admin as the base framework and focuses on managing test results, test cases, test planning, and automation.

## General Development Rules

### 1. File Structure and Organization
- Maintain folder structure by functionality: `/pages`, `/components`, `/firebase`, `/types`
- Each page should have its own folder with related components
- Reusable components go in `/components` organized by domain
- TypeScript types should be centralized in `/types/index.ts`
- Use descriptive names for files and folders in English

### 2. Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `TestResultsPage`, `CustomAppBar`)
- **Files**: PascalCase for React components, camelCase for utilities
- **Variables and functions**: camelCase
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with descriptive prefix (e.g., `TestResult`, `TestStep`)

### 3. React/TypeScript Code Standards
- Use strict TypeScript for all files
- Define interfaces for all component props
- Use React Admin hooks when possible (`useSidebarState`, etc.)
- Implement ErrorBoundary for error handling
- Use Material-UI for consistent UI components

### 4. Component Structure
- Each component should have its own file
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for props
- Separate business logic from presentation components
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic

### 5. Firebase and State
- Centralize Firebase configuration in `/firebase/config.ts`
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Implement authentication and data providers in `/firebase/`
- Handle loading and error states in all Firebase operations

### 6. Styles and UI
- Use Material-UI as the main design system
- Implement custom theme with brand colors (#4B3C9D)
- Use sx prop for component-specific styles
- Maintain visual consistency throughout the application
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes

### 7. Data Management
- Use React Admin dataProvider for CRUD operations
- Implement data validation in forms
- Handle loading, success, and error states
- Use TypeScript types for data structures
- Implement pagination and filters when necessary

### 8. Testing and QA
- Write unit tests for critical components
- Implement integration tests for main flows
- Use automated testing tools (Playwright)
- Document test cases in the system
- Maintain adequate test coverage

### 9. Security
- Implement mandatory authentication (`requireAuth`)
- Validate user permissions for sensitive operations
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep Firebase credentials secure

### 10. Performance and Optimization
- Use React.memo for components that don't change frequently
- Implement lazy loading for routes and heavy components
- Optimize images and assets
- Use Vite for efficient bundling
- Implement appropriate caching

### 11. Documentation and Comments
- Document APIs and complex functions
- Use JSDoc comments for public functions
- Keep README updated with installation instructions
- Document important architectural decisions
- Comment complex or non-obvious code

### 12. Git and Versioning
- Use conventional commits for descriptive messages
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Make small and frequent commits
- Use pull requests for code review
- Keep git history clean

### 13. QA Domain-Specific Features
- Implement quality metrics in the dashboard
- Create detailed test result reports
- Integrate with automated testing tools
- Implement notifications for critical failures
- Maintain test execution history

### 14. Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML
- Implement appropriate ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Maintain adequate color contrast
- Test with screen readers

### 15. Internationalization (i18n)
- Prepare structure for multiple languages
- Use consistent translation keys
- Implement localized date and number formatting
- Keep UI texts separate from logic

## React Admin Specific Rules
- Use React Admin resources for CRUD operations
- Implement custom layouts when necessary
- Use React Admin authentication and data providers
- Maintain consistency with React Admin patterns
- Customize UI components while maintaining base functionality

## Deployment Rules
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement CI/CD for automated testing
- Configure Firebase Hosting for deployment
- Maintain different configurations for dev/prod
- Implement monitoring and logging in production
